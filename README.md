Delta kite calculator
====================
Calculates a "Dan Leigh standard delta kite" from provided nose angle and center line length. 

To Do: 
-------------------
- fix, or remove, spreader length calculation. The exact spreader length depends on the spreader's pockets, and needs to be custom fit.
 - update the code's style, was written 10+ years ago, before I learned to program
